# Todo project

## Assignment

The assignment is to complete a to-do app with frontend/backend/DB. The time limit is 3 hrs.

## Process

Honestly, I cannot finish a full frontend/backend/DB app within 3 hrs. But by using some boilerplate, we can achieve something quick. So due to this reason, I choose to use firebase and a boilerplate for basic app structure. Some points about what blocks me:

- choose a way to do fast development
  - ReactJS
  - Firebase realtime DB
  - boilerplate
- get familiar with firebase
  - how to setup
  - how to create
  - how to update

## What can be improved

- todo component can be extracted out Home component
- todo component can be more detailed according to the design sample
- Add styles to the todo component
- firebase DB rules can be more complete (user can only view own tasks)
- after completing required features, UX can be improved.
  - slide to complete
  - slide to star
- Categories in different nav page through routes
- add task filters (view deleted/completed/starred tasks)

## About assignment

I think this assignment will mainly test developers fast developing skill. If a developer is very familiar with setting up a new project, new server/DB, this project will be ok. If not, the developer will be stuck at how to start the project quickly.

## Conclusion

I am not used to setting up a project from the beginning. So I think I find the right way to approach the project. Using firebase/boilerplate, I have set up the server without spending too much time. However, I still spend some time to get familiar with the tool. I regret that I couldn't at least finish the required features. In the end, to prepare for the type of fast development assignment, I think I should do some more small projects to practice quick thinking, architecting and styling from scratch.
